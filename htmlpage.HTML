    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hpertext Markup Language</p>
    <p>It is basic code that makes webpages but it does not make the webpage interactive</p>
    <p>HTML was created by a man named Tim Berners-Lee and ever since then HTML has grown more and become more popular to modern society</p>
    <p>It is written with different tags that allow websites to do many different things</p>
    <h2>What is CSS</h2>

    </div>    
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</p>
    <p>It is code that is used to design the HTML website and it makes the website interactive</p>
    <p>CSS was created in 1995 and didnt start being used untill 1996 and ever since then it has been growing more and more everyday</p>
    <p>it is written with different id's from the HTML and it uses that to edit it so that it comes out the way you want it to</p>

    </div>         
    <p>Tags all work differently because each tag does a different thing like for example there are list tags, header tags, and scentence tags</p>
    <p>There is a paragraph tag and that allows you to write senetnces like this one which is very helpful for people that are making websites</p>
    <p>There is a list tag that allows you to make a list of items and make it able to organize it easier this is helpful to organize things</p>
    <p>There is also a text-align tag that makes it so that a variable you have like a list can be centered or wherever you want it to appear and this is helpful so that way everything is not on one spot on the page</p>
    <p>Finally there is a header tag that makes it so that you can title the head of a section this is helpful for indicating what you are going to show for a section</p>
